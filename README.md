Rapid API development with Lionframe
=======

PHP Summer Camp 2015 workshop dedicated to rapid API development.

Description
-----------

Building applications that follow the REST architectural style can be quite hard and troublesome. Like most other web frameworks out there, Symfony does not have any built-in mechanism for building well-behaved web APIs. On the other hand, there are many open source libraries that we can find useful, so make use of them! I will show you how easy it can be to build your own mature, RESTful API using open-source software and even how you can do it in minutes using Lionframe! During the workshop we will implement a simple web application together with its API. Knowledge of PHP is everything you need to take part in this workshop.
